I am a visitor responsible to visit Magritte descriptions. I am an abstract class providing a default implementation for concrete visitors. The protocol I am implementing reflects the hierarchy of *MADescription* with its subclasses so that visiting a specific class automatically calls less specific implementations in case the specific implementation has been left out. The code was automatically created using code on my class-side.
